## Overview
This repo provides a library of customizable, touch-based, character controllers for Unity's AR Foundation for Android. I made this to speed up development and to collate resources, since many applications need controllers, yet tutorials are scattered and typically take the form of YouTube videos. People can attach the scripts found here to characters while adjusting features such as speed and acceleration.
